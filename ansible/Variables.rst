Variables
=========
Cephmetrics allows for a number of variables to be set in order to change the default behavior of many of the Ansible roles used for deployment.

Defaults for each role's variables are stored in
``roles/<role_name>/defaults/main.yml``\ , as the value of a ``dict`` called
``defaults``. A fake example for simplicity's sake:

.. code-block::

   $ cat ./ceph-fake-role/defaults/main.yaml
   ---
   defaults:
     fake_role:
       a_dict:
         a_key: a_value
       another_option: true


While each role's variables are stored as a single dict, individual values may be overridden without having to redundantly specify values for the rest. Using the above example, if you wanted to override ``another_option``:

.. code-block::

  $ cat ./my-inventory/group_vars/all.yml
  ---
  fake_role:
    another_option: false


Below, we'll document the variables used by our various roles.

ceph-collectd
-------------
Note that these variables *only* apply to ``collectd``\ -based deployments, which
are deprecated.

``cluster``\ : The name of the Ceph cluster

``collector_dependencies.(yum|apt)``\ : Lists of packages that the cephmetrics
collectors require. Should not need overriding.


ceph-docker
-----------
``docker.packages.(yum|apt)``\ : The names of the ``docker`` and ``docker-python``
packages to install

``network_name``\ : The name of the Docker network to create for the containers

``service_name``\ : The name of the ``systemd`` service that controls the ``docker``
daemon. This will depend on the package used; for example, RHEL offers an
alternative ``docker-latest`` package which would require setting this value to
``docker-latest`` as well.

ceph-grafana
------------
Top-level settings
``````````````````
``replace_dashboards``\ : Whether to override existing dashboards with the same name. Default: true

``update_alerts``\ : Whether to update the alerts dashboard along with the rest. Removes any user-defined alerts. Default: false

``devel_packages.(yum|apt)``\ : Dependency packages to install when in ``devel_mode``.


``grafana`` settings
````````````````````
``container_name``\ : The name of the container to use, in ``[registry[:port]/]user/repo`` format. Default: ``grafana/grafana``.

``container_cpu_period``\ : This is passed to docker using the ``--cpu-period`` flag. Default: ``100000``

``container_cpu_cores``\ : This is multiplied by ``container_cpu_period`` and passed to docker using the ``--cpu-quota`` flag. Default: ``2``

``container_memory``\ : The size of the container's RAM quota, in GB. Default: ``4``

``version``\ : Only for containers; this is the tag value passed to docker. Default: ``latest``

``uid``\ : The UID of the ``grafana-server`` process inside the container. Default: ``472``

``datasource``\ : The name of the datasource to create in Grafana. Currently unsafe to change. Default: ``Local``

``admin_user`` and ``admin_password``\ : These are safe to set on new deployments. If you need to change the admin user's password later, use the web UI and then override the setting. Default: ``admin``/``admin``

``plugins``\ : The Grafana plugins to install. Default: ``vonage-status-panel, grafana-piechart-panel``


ceph-graphite
-------------
Top-level settings
``````````````````

``devel_packages.(yum|apt)``\ : Dependency packages to install when in ``devel_mode``.


ceph-mgr
--------
There are no variables to set for this role.

ceph-node-exporter
------------------
``node_exporter`` settings
``````````````````````````

``arch_map``\ : When in ``devel_mode``, this is used when searching for upstream releases to download. Users should not need to override this.

``packages.(apt|yum)``\ : The name of the ``node_exporter`` package. Only relevant when ``devel_mode = false``.

``service_name``\ : The name of the ``systemd`` service controlling ``node_exporter``. On RHEL, this should be set to ``prometheus-node-exporter``. Default: ``node_exporter``.


ceph-prometheus
---------------
``prometheus``

.. code-block::

   prometheus:
     container_name: prom/prometheus
     container_cpu_period: 100000
     container_cpu_cores: 2
     # container_memory is in GB
     container_memory: 4
     # This is passed directly to the docker_container module. It is only used
     # for containerized deployments.
     etc_hosts: {}
     version: latest
     data_dir: /var/lib/cephmetrics
     user_id: '65534'  # This is the UID used by the prom/prometheus docker image


cephmetrics-common
------------------

Top-level settings
``````````````````

``devel_mode``\ : This setting controls various aspects of the deployment. Currently, ``devel_mode`` is most suitable for most non-RHEL users.

``containerized``\ : Whether or not to deploy Grafana and Prometheus as containers (as opposed to packages)

``backend`` settings
````````````````````

``metrics``\ : The source of Ceph metrics. The default, and only supported setting is ``mgr``\ ; the older ``collectd`` system can be used by setting ``cephmetrics`` here.

``storage``\ : The storage mechanism used for the metrics. With ``mgr`` metrics, use ``prometheus``. With ``cephmetrics``, use ``collectd``.
